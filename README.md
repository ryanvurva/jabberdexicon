![tech jargon glossary](jebberdexicon.gif)

A glossary of Tech jargon idea from my teacher at code camp.  To build this we used React components and React Router.  There is a browse feature for every letter and number, as well as a search feature for letters or words.  It is supposed responsive to the letter as you are typing.  You can view, edit, delete, and add new terms as well.  Really good fun eith a lot of technical parts and features.
